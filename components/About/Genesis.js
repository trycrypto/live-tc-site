            Crypto technology continues to advance at a dizzying pace. Those
            brave enough to be on the bleeding edge are already experiencing its
            many benefits. But for mainstream users, crypto still remains
            opaque, something to read or hear about on the news when there’s a
            hack or a transaction involving a gargantuan sum of money. For them,
            using crypto remains largely out of reach because the experience is
            so high friction. Decentralized technology is intended to bring
            about economic equity in the world. But this too is stymied because
            of the usability problem.
            <br />
            <br />
            I founded TryCrypto to solve these problems. Our mission is to make
            crypto more accessible to mainstream users and we’ll do it with
            focus and empathy. Also, we’ll put an emphasis on projects that can
            help make global economic equity a reality.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to working on these problems, I also want TryCrypto to
            be a bright, shining beacon for the world to see that women can not
            only excel in the crypto domain, but their innate empathy enables
            them to create amazing solutions that move the entire ecosystem
            forward without leaving those less privileged or less abled behind.
            To this end, TryCrypto will be a women-led, women-first organization
            as it begins its journey toward a more equitable world.
